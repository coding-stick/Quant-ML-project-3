# 📈 Predicting the S&P 500 with Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to use machine learning to predict the S&P 500 using a combination of **technical indicators** and **macroeconomic data**. It includes both **regression** (predicting percent return) and **classification** (predicting direction: up/down) models.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The dataset is **not included**. You’ll need to fetch and clean your own data from public sources like [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) or [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) and put them in /data folder. Part of the challenge is knowing what to look for 😈

## 📚 Features

- Historical S&P 500 data going back as far as **1875**
- Combines technical indicators like:
  - MACD
  - RSI
  - EMA
  - Bollinger Bands
- Integrates macroeconomic indicators like:
  - Interest rates (daily yield curve)
  - Inflation
  - Consumer sentiment
  - Unemployment
  - Durable goods orders
  - VIX (volatility index)
- Supports:
  - Regression (predicting next-month % change)
  - Classification (predicting direction)
- Evaluation metrics:
  - R² Score
  - MAE / RMSE
  - Accuracy (for classification)
- Clean, modular structure for reproducibility

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- (optional) `fredapi` for pulling macro data from FRED
