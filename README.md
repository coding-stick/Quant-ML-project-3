📈 Predicting the S&P 500 with Machine Learning
This project explores building a machine learning model to predict the S&P 500 using a combination of technical indicators and macroeconomic data. The model supports both regression (predicting % change) and classification (predicting direction: up/down), and is built using pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

🚨 Note: The data used in this project is not included. Please fetch your own datasets from sources like FRED or Yahoo Finance and put it into a /data folder. Part of the challenge is knowing what to look for.

📚 Features
📅 Uses S&P 500 data going back as far as 1875

🧠 Combines technical indicators (MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, EMA, etc.)

🏛️ Incorporates macroeconomic signals (interest rates, inflation, unemployment, sentiment, durable goods orders)

⚙️ Supports both regression and classification modeling

📊 Evaluates models using R², MAE, accuracy, and more

🛠️ Clean, modular code with easily swappable models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, etc.)

🔧 Requirements
Python 3.8+

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

(optional) FRED API key if using real macro data

📡 Data Sources
The following sources are useful for replicating this project:

FRED — macroeconomic indicators

Yahoo Finance — S&P 500 historical data

CBOE — VIX volatility index

Quandl — alternative data (optional)

⚠️ Note: You will need to source and clean your own data. Trust me, it's part of the fun 😈

🚀 Getting Started
Once you have your data in place:

bash
